# Arabic Morphological Analysis

This project contains some quick-and-dirty Python and Scala scripts for dealing with Arabic. Specifically, for transliterating and lemmatizing Arabic. Note that I am NOT an Arabic speaker (I just had call to do some NLP tasks on some Arabic text). A lot of this is just a port of Buckwalter's code to Python and Scala.
